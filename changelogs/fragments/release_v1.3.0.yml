release_summary: Add support for alternative DNS values to CA
feature:
  - Non-production CA initialization, adds support for additional DNS entries, e.g. "example.local". Retains the automatically generated entries using the host's FQDN and IP address determined by Ansible.
known_issues:
  - The collection can fail to pull the latest step-ca and step-cli versions from GitHub when use in large deployments or during repetitive testing.
    This is due to hitting GitHub's API rate limiter (60 unauthenticated request per hour), we recommend setting 'step_ca_version' and 'step_cli_version' (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/issues/42#issuecomment-3075048226).
