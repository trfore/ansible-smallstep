release_summary: Fix issues setting certificate valid periods
minor_changes:
  - extend test coverage for var options in 'step_certs' and 'step_provisioner' (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/pull/53).
bugfixes:
  - Fix 'not-after' variable, works as expected for the 'step_certs' task (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/pull/50).
  - Add missing 'x509_max_dur variable' in the 'step_provisioner' task (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/pull/51).
known_issues:
  - The collection can fail to pull the latest step-ca and step-cli versions from GitHub when use in large deployments or during repetitive testing.
    This is due to hitting GitHub's API rate limiter (60 unauthenticated request per hour), we recommend setting 'step_ca_version' and 'step_cli_version' (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/issues/42#issuecomment-3075048226).
