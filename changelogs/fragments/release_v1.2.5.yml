release_summary: Fix issues using collection with Ansible 2.19
minor_changes:
  - Add sanity test and rm testing on EOL ansible 2.16 to local tox environments (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/pull/58).
  - Update supported ansible versions (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/pull/67).
bugfixes:
  - Fix remove template delimiters from assert conditions across all roles (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/pull/62).
known_issues:
  - The collection can fail to pull the latest step-ca and step-cli versions from GitHub when use in large deployments or during repetitive testing.
    This is due to hitting GitHub's API rate limiter (60 unauthenticated request per hour), we recommend setting 'step_ca_version' and 'step_cli_version' (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/issues/42#issuecomment-3075048226).
