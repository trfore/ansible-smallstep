release_summary: Allow for blank spaces in the CA name
minor_changes:
  - add test for CA names with spacing (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/pull/46).
bugfixes:
  - quote CA name to handle spaces in step_ca init (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/pull/45).
  - update SSH task to accept spacing in provisioner name (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/pull/47).
known_issues:
  - The collection can fail to pull the latest step-ca and step-cli versions from GitHub when use in large deployments or during repetitive testing.
    This is due to hitting GitHub's API rate limiter (60 unauthenticated request per hour), we recommend setting 'step_ca_version' and 'step_cli_version' (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/issues/42#issuecomment-3075048226).
