release_summary: Add testing for Ansible 2.18, and remove testing/support for Ubuntu 20.04
breaking_changes:
  - Remove testing support for Ubuntu 20 as it approaches EOL on 31 May 2025.
bugfixes:
  - Align tox dependencies with dev-requirements file to keep local molecule calls and tox testing at parity.
minor_changes:
  - Update tox test matrix to test Ansible 2.18.
  - Pin Ansible python packages 'ansible-compat' and 'molecule', see issue 30.
known_issues:
  - The collection can fail to pull the latest step-ca and step-cli versions from GitHub when use in large deployments or during repetitive testing.
    This is due to hitting GitHub's API rate limiter (60 unauthenticated request per hour), we recommend setting 'step_ca_version' and 'step_cli_version' (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/issues/42#issuecomment-3075048226).
