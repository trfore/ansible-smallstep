      bugfixes:
      - Align tox dependencies with dev-requirements file to keep local molecule calls

      known_issues:
      - The collection can fail to pull the latest step-ca and step-cli versions from
        GitHub when use in large deployments or during repetitive testing. This is
        due to hitting GitHub's API rate limiter (60 unauthenticated request per hour),
        we recommend setting 'step_ca_version' and 'step_cli_version' (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/issues/42#issuecomment-3075048226).
      minor_changes:
      - Pin Ansible python packages 'ansible-compat' and 'molecule', see issue 30.
      - Update tox test matrix to test Ansible 2.18.
